# dotnet-hedgehog

[Hedgehog](http://hedgehog.qa/) is a modern property-based testing system, in the spirit of QuickCheck. Hedgehog offers a simplified model for writing properies with not only `gen` but also `property` expressions. Hedgehog does shrinking automatically, which means it can shrink anything it can generate. Hedgehog has adequate randomness based on the SplitMix algorithm.

## Building

In order to build dotnet-hedgehog, ensure that you have [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and [F#](http://fsharp.org/) installed.

Clone a copy of the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/hedgehogqa/dotnet-hedgehog.git
```

Change to the dotnet-hedgehog directory:

```
cd dotnet-hedgehog
```

Use one of the following to build and test:

```
./build.sh Build      # Build Hedgehog into src/Hedgehog/bin/Release
./build.sh Test       # Run tests using the xUnit.net console runner
./build.sh NuGet      # Create a NuGet Package into .nuget directory
```


## Usage

```f#
property {
    let! xs = g
    return List.rev (List.rev xs) = xs
}
```

where `g` is either a built-in generator or a custom one. See the [quick tutorial](doc/TUTORIAL.md) for some examples.

## Versioning

Hedgehog follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

According to [semantic versioning specification](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html#spec-item-4
), until version 1.0.0 is released, major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.

## Limitations

Some of the features you'd expect from a property-based testing system are still missing, but we'll get there eventually:

* Generating functions
* Model-based testing

Hedgehog doesn't have an Arbitrary type class, by design. The main purpose of the Arbitrary class is to link the generator with a shrink function â€” this isn't required with Hedgehog so Arbitrary has been eliminated.
