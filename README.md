# dotnet-jack

An alternative property-based testing system for F#, in the spirit of John Hughes & Koen Classen's [QuickCheck](https://web.archive.org/web/20160319204559/http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/john-hughes/quick.pdf). The key improvement is that shrinking comes for free.

*Jack's love of dice has brought him here, where he has taken on the form of an F# library, in order to help you gamble with your properties.*

## Highlights

* Shrinking is baked into the `Gen` type, so you get it for free. This is not a trivial distinction. Integrating shrinking into generation has two large benefits:
  * Shrinking composes nicely, and you can shrink anything you can generate regardless of whether there is a defined shrinker for the type produced.
  * You can guarantee that shrinking satisfies the same invariants as generation.
* Simplified model; just generators and properties.
* Adequate randomness based on the SplitMix algorithm.
* Convenient syntax for both generators and properties with not only `gen` but also `property` expressions.

## At a glance

Given any generator of type Î±, Jack not only generates *random values* of type Î±, but also *shrinks* Î± into smaller values.

Jack comes with built-in generators for primitive types, so here's how it would generate a couple of integers and shrink them:

```f#
Gen.int
|> Gen.printSample;;

=== Outcome ===
0
=== Shrinks ===
.
=== Outcome ===
-12
=== Shrinks ===
0
-6
-9
-11
.
=== Outcome ===
-3
=== Shrinks ===
0
-2
.
=== Outcome ===
-29
=== Shrinks ===
0
-15
-22
-26
-28
.
=== Outcome ===
4
=== Shrinks ===
0
2
3
.
```

But Jack can also take on complex types, and shrink them for free:

```f#
Gen.byte
|> Gen.map int
|> Gen.tuple3
|> Gen.map (fun (ma, mi, bu) -> Version (ma, mi, bu)) // Major, Minor, Build
|> Gen.printSample;;

#### ðŸ‘‰ Automatic shrinking is an important quality of Jack

When a property fails (because Jack found a counter-example), the randomly-generated data usually contains "noise". Therefore Jack simplifies counter-examples before reporting them:

```f#
let version =
    Gen.byte
    |> Gen.map int
    |> Gen.tuple3
    |> Gen.map (fun (ma, mi, bu) -> Version (ma, mi, bu))

property { let! xs = Gen.list version
           return xs |> List.rev = xs } |> Property.print

>
*** Failed! Falsifiable (after 3 tests and 6 shrinks):
[0.0.0; 0.0.1]
```

The above example, is the standard "hello-world" property, but instead of the classic list of integers, we're using a list of type System.Version, demonstrating that integrated shrikning works with 'foreign' types too.

*As a matter of fact, here's the above example written using another property-based testing system, FsCheck:*

```f#
let version =
    Arb.generate<byte>
    |> Gen.map int
    |> Gen.three
    |> Gen.map (fun (ma, mi, bu) -> Version (ma, mi, bu))
    |> Gen.listOf
    |> Arb.fromGen

version
|> Prop.forAll <| fun xs -> xs |> List.rev = xs
|> Check.Quick

>
Falsifiable, after 2 tests (0 shrinks) (StdGen (783880299,296237326)):
Original:
[183.211.153; 129.237.113; 242.27.80]
```
You can find out more about integrated vs type-based shrinking in [this](http://hypothesis.works/articles/integrated-shrinking/) blog post.

### Getting Started

The standard "hello-world" property shown in most property-based testing systems is:

```
reverse (reverse xs) = xs, âˆ€xs :: [Î±]
```

which means that "the reverse of the reverse of a list, is the list itself - for all lists of type Î±".

One way to use `dotnet-jack` to check the above property is to use the `property` computation expression:

```f#
property { let! xs = Gen.list Gen.int
           return List.rev (List.rev xs) = xs }
```

and to test the above property on 100 random lists of integers, pipe it into `Property.print`:

```f#
property { let! xs = Gen.list Gen.int
           return List.rev (List.rev xs) = xs }
|> Property.print

+++ OK, passed 100 tests.
```

## NuGet

There isn't much here yet, but `dotnet-jack` can be published on NuGet once it's in a usable state.

## Versioning

`dotnet-jack` follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) once itâ€™s in a usable state.

## Credits

The idea behind `dotnet-jack` originates from [`purescript-jack`](https://github.com/jystic/purescript-jack/) in PureScript and [`disorder-jack`](https://github.com/ambiata/disorder.hs/tree/master/disorder-jack/) in Haskell.
