[Hedgehog](http://hedgehog.qa/) is a modern property-based testing
system, in the spirit of QuickCheck. Hedgehog uses integrated shrinking,
so shrinks obey the invariants of generated values by construction.

## Features

- Integrated shrinking, shrinks obey invariants by construction.
- Convenient syntax for generators and properties with `gen` and `property` expressions.
- Range combinators for full control over the scope of generated numbers and collections.

## Example

The root namespace, `Hedgehog`, includes almost
everything you need to get started writing property tests with Hedgehog.

```fsharp
open Hedgehog
```

Once you have your import declaration set up, you can write a simple property:

```fsharp
let propReverse : Property<Unit> =
    property {
        let! xs = Gen.list (Range.linear 0 100) Gen.alpha
        return xs |> List.rev |> List.rev = xs
        }
```

You can then load the module in F# Interactive, and run it:

```
> Property.print propReverse
+++ OK, passed 100 tests.
```

More examples can be found in the [tutorial](doc/index.md).

## C#/LINQ Example

Hedgehog provides an alternative namespace, meant to provide compatibility with other .NET languages. To use this, simply import the `Hedgehog.Linq` namespace. The base `Hedgehog` namespace isn't necessary in this scenario.

Generators are then built with a more comfortable fluent API.

```csharp
using Hegehog.Linq;

class Generators
{
    static void Example()
    {
        // This creates a generator for 10 character strings, with only alphabetical characters.
        var stringLength = 10;
        var stringGen = Gen.String(Gen.Alpha, Range.FromValue(stringLength));

        // This creates a property that can be printed, checked, or re-checked.
        var property =
            from string in Property.ForAll(stringGen)
            select Assert.AreEqual(stringLength, string.Length);

        // Checking accepts an argument for the number of test cases to generate and check.
        property.Check(tests: 30);
    }
}
```

## Building from source

To build Hedgehog from source, you will need either the
[.NET Core SDK or Visual Studio][net-core-sdk].

### Building & running tests

With Visual Studio you can build Hedgehog and run the tests
from inside the IDE, otherwise with the `dotnet` command-line
tool you can execute:

```shell
dotnet build
```

To run the tests, you can execute:

```shell
dotnet test tests/Hedgehog.Tests/Hedgehog.Tests.fsproj
dotnet test tests/Hedgehog.Linq.Tests/Hedgehog.Linq.Tests.csproj
```

### Building the NuGet package

As of https://github.com/hedgehogqa/fsharp-hedgehog/pull/253/ a NuGet package is created automatically during build.

If you want to manually create a NuGet package you can run:

```shell
dotnet pack src/Hedgehog/Hedgehog.fsproj -c Release
```

This will produce `Hedgehog-x.y.z.nupkg` in `src/Hedgehog/bin/Release`.

## Development Environments

### Visual Studio

Hedgehog can be developed in Visual Studio, once these requirements are met:

- .NET Core (2.1+) and .NET Framework (4.5.1+) are installed.

### Visual Studio Code

Hedgehog can be developed in Visual Studio Code, with a couple of scenarios supported.

#### Bare Metal

Developing on bare metal is essentially the same as developing in Visual Studio, install the appropriate .NET SDK then open the project folder.

#### Remote Containers

Development can also be done using [Remote Development][remote-containers-doc].

The steps to get this up and running are as follows:

1. Install [Docker][docker-install].
2. Install the [Remote Containers][remote-containers-ext] extension.
3. Open the project folder, then run the `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` command.
