### Getting Started

The standard "hello-world" property shown in most property-based testing systems is:

```fs
reverse (reverse xs) = xs, ∀xs :: [α]
```

which means that "the reverse of the reverse of a list, is the list itself - for all lists of type α".

One way to use Hedgehog to check the above property is to use the `property` computation expression:

```fs
property {
    let! xs = Range.constant 0 1000 |> Gen.int |> Gen.list (Range.linear 0 100)
    return List.rev (List.rev xs) = xs
}
```

and to test the above property on 100 random lists of integers, pipe it into `Property.print`:

```fs
property {
    let! xs = Range.constant 0 1000 |> Gen.int |> Gen.list (Range.linear 0 100)
    return List.rev (List.rev xs) = xs
}
|> Property.print

+++ OK, passed 100 tests.
```

## At a glance

Given any generator of type α, Hedgehog not only generates *random values* of type α, but also *shrinks* α into smaller values.

Hedgehog comes with built-in generators for primitive types, so here's how it would generate a couple of integers and shrink them:

```fs
Range.constant 0 100
|> Gen.int
|> Gen.printSample;;

But Hedgehog can also take on complex types, and shrink them for free:

```fs
Range.constantBounded ()
|> Gen.byte
|> Gen.map int
|> Gen.tuple3
|> Gen.map (fun (ma, mi, bu) -> Version (ma, mi, bu))
|> Gen.printSample;;

#### 👉 Integrated shrinking is an important quality of Hedgehog

When a property fails (because Hedgehog found a counter-example), the randomly-generated data usually contains "noise". Therefore Hedgehog simplifies counter-examples before reporting them:

```fs
let version =
    Range.constantBounded ()
    |> Gen.byte
    |> Gen.map int
    |> Gen.tuple3
    |> Gen.map (fun (ma, mi, bu) -> Version (ma, mi, bu))

Property.print (property {
    let! xs = Gen.list (Range.linear 0 100) version
    return xs |> List.rev = xs
})

>
*** Failed! Falsifiable (after 3 tests and 6 shrinks):
[0.0.0; 0.0.1]
```

The above example, is the standard "hello-world" property, but instead of the classic list of integers, we're using a list of type System.Version, demonstrating that integrated shrinking works with 'foreign' types too.

---

*As a matter of fact, here's the above example written using another property-based testing system, FsCheck:*

```fs
let version =
    Arb.generate<byte>
    |> Gen.map int
    |> Gen.three
    |> Gen.map (fun (ma, mi, bu) -> Version (ma, mi, bu))
    |> Gen.listOf
    |> Arb.fromGen

version
|> Prop.forAll (fun xs -> xs |> List.rev = xs)
|> Check.Quick

>
Falsifiable, after 2 tests (0 shrinks) (StdGen (783880299,296237326)):
Original:
[183.211.153; 129.237.113; 242.27.80]
```

### Generators

Hedgehog's `Gen` module exports some basic generators and plenty combinators for making new generators. Here's a generator of alphanumeric characters:

```fs
Gen.alphaNum
```

This generator is of type `Gen<char>`, which means that Hedgehog can take this generator and produce characters, like so:

```fs
Gen.alphaNum |> Gen.printSample;;

=== Outcome ===
'3'
=== Shrinks ===
'l'
'L'
'0'
'2'
.
=== Outcome ===
'3'
=== Shrinks ===
'b'
'B'
'0'
'2'
.
=== Outcome ===
'3'
=== Shrinks ===
'x'
'X'
'0'
'2'
.
=== Outcome ===
'4'
=== Shrinks ===
'y'
'Y'
'0'
'2'
'3'
.
=== Outcome ===
't'
=== Shrinks ===
'a'
'j'
'o'
'r'
's'
.
```

### Properties

#### 👉 Generators can also be created using the `gen` expression

Hedgehog supports a convenient syntax for working with generators through the `gen` expression. Here's a way to define a generator of type `System.Net.IPAddress`:

```fs
open System.Net

let ipAddressGen : Gen<IPAddress> = gen {
    let! addr = Range.constantBounded () |> Gen.byte |> Gen.array (Range.singleton 4)
    return System.Net.IPAddress addr
}

ipAddressGen |> Gen.printSample;;

### Custom Operations

The `Property` module and its `property` expression supports a few [custom operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/fsharp/language-reference/computation-expressions#custom-operations) as well.

#### `counterexample`

Here's how the previous example could be written in order to carry along a friendlier message when it fails:

```fs
let tryAdd a b =
    if a > 100 then None // Nasty bug.
    else Some(a + b)

property { let! a = Range.constantBounded () |> Gen.int
           let! b = Range.constantBounded () |> Gen.int
           counterexample (sprintf "The value of a was %d." a)
           return tryAdd a b = Some(a + b) }
|> Property.print;;

>
*** Failed! Falsifiable (after 16 tests and 5 shrinks):
101
0
The value of a was 101.

```

#### `where`

Here’s how the previous example could be written so that in never fails:

```fs
let tryAdd a b =
    if a > 100 then None // Nasty bug.
    else Some(a + b)

property { let! a = Range.constantBounded () |> Gen.int
           let! b = Range.constantBounded () |> Gen.int
           where (a < 100)
           return tryAdd a b = Some(a + b) }
|> Property.print;;

>
*** Gave up after 100 discards, passed 95 tests.

```

Essentially, the `where` custom operation discards test cases which do not satisfy the given condition.

Test case generation continues until 100 cases (the default of `Property.print`) which do satisfy the condition have been found, or until an overall limit on the number of test cases is reached (to avoid looping if the condition never holds).

In this case a message such as

```
Gave up after 100 discards, passed 95 tests.
```

indicates that 95 test cases satisfying the condition were found, and that the property held in those 95 cases.

## Integrations

Use your favorite tools with Hedgehog.

Powerful integrations that help you and your team build properties in an easier way.

### Hedgehog.Experimental

[Hedgehog.Experimental](https://github.com/hedgehogqa/fsharp-hedgehog-experimental) contains auto-generators, à la AutoFixture, as well as other convenient combinators.

```fs
// Can generate all F# types (unions, records, lists, etc.) as well as POCOs
// with mutable properties or constructors.

type Union =
  | Husband of int
  | Wife of string

type Record =
  {Sport: string
   Time: TimeSpan}

let! union = GenX.auto<Union>
let! record = GenX.auto<Record>
```

### Hedgehog.Xunit

[Hedgehog.Xunit](https://github.com/dharmaturtle/fsharp-hedgehog-xunit) provides attributes which make it simpler to write [xUnit.net](https://xunit.net/) tests.

Our very first test may be reinterpreted as

```fs
[<Property>]
let ``Reversing a list twice yields the original list`` (xs: int list) =
    List.rev (List.rev xs) = xs
```

Arguments are generated with Hedgehog.Experimental.

### Regex-constrained strings

In Haskell, there's the [quickcheck-regex](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/quickcheck-regex) package, by [Audrey (唐鳳) Tang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tangaudrey), which allows to write and execute this:

```hs
generate (matching "[xX][0-9a-z]")
// Prints -> "''UVBw"
```

It exports a `matching` function that turns a Regular Expression into a [DFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton)/[NFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_finite_automaton) finite-state machine and then into a generator of strings matching that regex:

```hs
matching :: String -> Gen String
```

A similar generator in F# with Hedgehog can be written as shown below:

```fs
open Hedgehog
open Fare

/// Curried version of Regex.IsMatch, for indicating
/// whether a given regular expression finds a match
/// in the input string.
let matches candidate pattern =
    System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.IsMatch (candidate, pattern)

/// Generates a string that is guaranteed to
/// match the regular expression passed in.
let fromRegex (pattern : string) : Gen<string> =
    Gen.sized (fun size ->
        let xeger = Xeger pattern
        [ for i in 1..size -> xeger.Generate () ]
        |> Gen.item)
```

The `fromRegex` function uses the [.NET port](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Fare/) of [dk.brics.automaton](http://www.brics.dk/automaton/) and [xeger](https://code.google.com/p/xeger/).

Here's a way to use it:


```fs
let pattern = "^http\://[a-zA-Z0-9\-\.]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}(/\S*)?$"

Property.print (property {
    let! s = fromRegex pattern
    return matches s pattern
})

+++ OK, passed 100 tests.

```
