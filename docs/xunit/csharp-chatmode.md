# Copilot chatmode for Hedgehog and xUnit

Hedgehog provides a specialized chatmode for GitHub Copilot to help C# developers write property-based tests. Since
Hedgehog is not widely known to AI models, this chatmode includes a comprehensive API reference and property-based
testing patterns to guide AI agents in discovering universal properties and generating effective test cases.
